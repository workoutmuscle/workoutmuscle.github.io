            </p><p>I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. That's well and good except it means nothing to most of the users, who want to know if they have the. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build.</p>

        <p>Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app).

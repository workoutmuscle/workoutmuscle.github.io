            </p><p>(i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app). Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? 4 i got this to work with the latest build_runner and json_serializable versions after a long process of trying all of the above suggestions: My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console.</p>

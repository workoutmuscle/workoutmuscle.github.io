            </p><p>46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. That's well and good except it means nothing to most of the users, who want to know if they have the. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. I currently have an app displaying the build number in its title window. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. Because these components are the same as the ones.</p>

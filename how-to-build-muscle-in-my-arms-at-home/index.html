            </p><p>46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. Because these components are the same as the ones. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,. My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app). Build solution will perform an incremental build:</p>

            </p><p>My visual studio console application build was failing without showing any errors in the output console. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app). I currently have an app displaying the build number in its title window. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. 4 i got this to work with the latest build_runner and json_serializable versions after a long process of trying all of the above suggestions: If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't.</p>

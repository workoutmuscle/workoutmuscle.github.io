Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. I'm trying to set environment variables in docker container during the build but without success. (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. 46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. Even clean solution would fail silently, despite setting msbuild.</p>

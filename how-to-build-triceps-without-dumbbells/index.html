            </p><p>46 i do not know if i understood right , the difference between a build and rebuild command of a project in visual studio is the fact that a build only compiles the code. What is the difference between npm install and npm run build? (i have always made applications from scratch.) then, after i was kind of happy with it, i decided to run npm. Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g.,.apk for an android app). Setting them when using run command works but i need to set them during the build. The build tools give you a way to install the tools you need on your build machines without the ide you don’t need. If it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. I have noticed in my project that sometimes npm starts failing when npm install is performed, but, upon running npm run build,.</p>

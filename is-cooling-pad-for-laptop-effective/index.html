Discover key facts about microplastics and find out what solutions the eu is working on. Where do microplastics come from and what are their effects? Microplastics are classified into two types based on how they originate. Microplastics, small pieces of plastic, less than 5 mm (0.2 inch) in length, that occur in the environment as a consequence of plastic pollution. Plastic debris can come in all shapes and sizes, but those that are less than five millimeters in length (or about the size of a pencil eraser) are called “microplastics.” as an. Microplastics can enter the human body through ingestion and inhalation. Primary microplastics are those that are manufactured to be less than 5mm, sometimes for use in.</p>

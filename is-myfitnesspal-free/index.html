            </p><p>This discussion is a place to share the myfitnesspal groups that have helped you the most or inspired you along your journey. This forum category, myfitnesspal tech support questions, is the place for you. In a survey sent to myfitnesspal members last year, 95% of respondents indicated that they were interested in seeing a dashboard feature — the highest requested feature out of 20 potential. Myfitnesspal has one of the world's largest food databases with over 20 million foods available to search, but what if you need to log a food that isn't in the database yet? Found this and thought it was actually useful: Ask questions and get help from other members on anything health and weight loss related. We’re excited to invite you to explore the new myfitnesspal academy category. Myfitnesspal.com the site myfitnesspal.com has been reported to possibly have suffered a data exposure that could include emails, usernames and passwords.</p>

A number of changes coming in december 2025 for east midlands railway services across the region. The northern part of the line originally opened in 1896 as the liverpool and. The railway was a very different place back then despite mostly comprising the same set of routes. Good evening all, we're just about to see the december 2024 change take effect so thought it'd be a good time to start up a thread for the next change in may 2025. The callander and oban railway is a historic railway, part of which is abandoned and part still in use. It was certainly shown as part of the merseyrail wirral line at one time this map from 1992 shows.</p>

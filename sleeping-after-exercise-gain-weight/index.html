            </p><p>She'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed. Sleeping is the closest i can get to being dead without hurting my family reply reply. What if i no one noticed i was missing until rounds? Light jolteon has a sleeping togepi if you wanna count that. Stay awake, this is a returning feature from the ps2 version. I came to the conclusion that leaving it on stand by mode or sleep mode is probably better because the action of turning it off and then turning it on again causes more. A few days ago, i went over to my friends house. When she got out the shower, she went to the room she was sleeping in and changed however didn't close the door completely for whatever reason.</p>

        <p>After that night, she slept in my bed every night for about four nights. Real, every second awake is another second dealing with unbearable pain and loneliness. In medical school i had this great fear that in residency, i‘d accidentally sleep in, which would be an absolute disaster.</p>

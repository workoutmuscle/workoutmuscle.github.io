            </p><p>It was starting to rain would make it feel like. Starting date makes sense but it sounds a bit wrong. The gerund starting, however, is a verb acting as a noun, so it can have a direct object, so starting his job is a valid noun phrase, and it can come after the preposition to. However, your sentence does not refer to a price range but rather the starting point of a price range. Starting from is less common, and. In general, it is correct to use from when talking about a price range. If i replace ' will be starting' with 'will start', is there. 2 beginning in or starting in followed by a year is common and correct for referring to something that occurred over multiple years.</p>

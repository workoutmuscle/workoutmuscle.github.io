            </p><p>Hi, i would like to phrase an out of office letter. Yeah in training not on. Instead, retrain on a different training/test split and see if you get similar results (time. The solution in practice would be to not make the decision based only on those numbers. I would use 'training on' only for specific objects/machinery etc. I'm on training during this week. If you were on traning, you would be using the word on as expressing an action, like you were literally on training like that boy is on drugs but if we are. I'm in a training during this week.</p>

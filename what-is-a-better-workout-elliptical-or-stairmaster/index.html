With better doing, 8 of the 13 instances looked as if they followed your structure. But i will insist on do you feel better now. I want to give her my suggestion on the food. Better can be used as a verb to replace improve with the same meaning. The management team have promised to chose the options better suited to their clients' needs. And how do you know when you heard someone. You would better study hard or you would be in a big trouble. using would better is still too pushy even between friends talk?</p>

            </p><p>Skinner's behaviorism theory, emphasizing the role of reinforcement in shaping behavior. Psychologists in the late 1800s and early 1900s believed that rewards and punishments were crucial to shaping and encouraging voluntary behavior. Reward and punishment can change children’s behaviors, so the two strategies are widely used in education, especially with young learners. Behaviorism in education, or behavioral learning theory, is a branch of psychology that focuses on how people learn through their interactions with the environment. Furthermore, the new work by the authors cited. Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior. Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or. A major tenet of behavioral theory is operant conditioning which suggests that likelihood of a behavior occurring is increased or decreased as a result of reward and punishment.</p>

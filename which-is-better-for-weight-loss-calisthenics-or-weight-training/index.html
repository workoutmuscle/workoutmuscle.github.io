            </p><p>My mother is now cooking meat in the kitchen. You can certainly say that, effect3. I want to give her my suggestion on the food. While are you feeling better refers to someone, let's say, who catches a cold and the next day you raise the question are you. 1.“mom, it would be better if you added some sugar to the meat. 2.“mom, it would. I'd have said that get better at is the more usual of the two, but i wouldn't label either get better in japanese or how to get better in sports as being wrong. You would better study hard or you would be in a big trouble. using would better is still too pushy even between friends talk? Whether you use the less the better, the fewer the better or the smaller the better depends on what adjective fits for the noun that you are talking about.</p>
